### With the new Bakery Mono SH update an adapter is no longer needed and I would not recommend using it. Mono SH givies very close results to SH while taking up 3 times less memory. Update Bakery to use it ` Bakery > Utilities > Check for patches`</b>


### How to use SH and RNM:

- Import the [Unity Package](https://github.com/z3y/UdonBakeryAdapter/releases)
- Drag the prefab in the scene
- Click Update Properties after baking

Properties should automatically update on world build, if not update manually after baking

[Bakery Mode Utility](https://github.com/z3y/BakeryModeUtility) An editor script for managing bakery keywords on all materials in the scene
